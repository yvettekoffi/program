        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
        <p>I am a Front-end and back-end Developer with a handful of projects. I create successful websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices.</p>
        <p>I work to make a better web; one that is fast, easy to use, beautiful, accessible to all, and frustration-free.</p>
        <p>My main experience is in front-end development but I also have a passion for design. Given that producing a modern website requires the combination of design, server technology, and the layer that users interacts with, I believe having experience in both design and development allows for making the most optimal user experiences.</p>
